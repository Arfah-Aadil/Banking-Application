# Banking-Application
a Java-based command-line banking application that allows users to manage bank accounts with essential functionalities. Each bank account includes an account holder's name, a balance, and a transaction history. The program starts with at least two predefined accounts and supports listing all account names, viewing individual account details (including balance and transactions), adding new transactions that update the balance, removing accounts from the system, and creating new accounts with an initial balance. The implementation follows a structured and user-friendly approach, ensuring smooth interaction through command-line inputs. The program is designed to be modular and maintainable, with clear logic for handling account operations. To run the application, compile and execute the Java program in a terminal, following the provided prompts to interact with the banking system.
