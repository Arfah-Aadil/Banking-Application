# Banking-Application
My goal is to write a command-line program, in Java, to act as a simple banking application, with bank accounts. Each bank account has a name (the person holding the account), a balance and a list of transactions. List of features that the program should have:
1.	The ability to list all bank accounts’ names in the system – there should be at least two in the program when it is first run [1]
2.	The ability to view an individual bank account with its balance and list of transactions [2]
3.	The ability to add new transactions to a bank account’s list of transactions – this should also affect the account’s balance [4]
4.	The ability to remove any bank account from the system [3]
5.	The ability to create new bank accounts, with an initial name and balance that the user may provide [2]

It is up to you how you design the steps of this command-line program, as long as you include the functionality detailed above. Each of the functionalities above is given a points score in brackets (to make a total of 12); this relates to the Functionality assessment criterion below.
